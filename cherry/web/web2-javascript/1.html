      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/">Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for
       <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong>
      web pages and web application.HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations;
      it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming
      interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile
      applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

      Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, the new video,
      audio and canvas elements were added, and support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical
      formulas was also added. To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as main, section,
      article, header, footer, aside, nav, and figure are added. New attributes were introduced, some elements and attributes
      were removed, and others such as a, cite, and menu were changed, redefined, or standardized. The APIs and Document
      Object Model (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification, and HTML5 also better defines the processing
      for any invalid documents.
